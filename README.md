# Dynamic QR Code Generator

### DEMO: https://dynamic-qr-code-generator-lac.vercel.app/

This project is a web application built with React (potentially using Next.js or Create React App) that allows users to generate QR codes dynamically from URLs. It provides a simple interface where users can enter a URL, and upon submission, a QR code is generated and displayed on the screen. This tool is useful for quickly creating QR codes for websites, online resources, or any valid URL.

## Features

- **URL Validation**: Ensures that the input text is a valid URL before generating the QR code.
- **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: Generates QR codes in real-time as the user inputs a valid URL.
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages for invalid URLs or issues during QR code generation.
